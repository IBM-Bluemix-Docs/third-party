# Step 1. Creating your documentation and marketing announcement
{: #content-tasks}

You can use the IBM Provider workbench to create your getting started documentation and marketing announcement.
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #marketing-prereqs}

Make sure that you completed the [getting started tutorial](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-get-started#get-started), and you're approved to deliver an integrated billing service.

## Create your getting started documentation
{: #gs-docs}

To deliver an integrated billing service, you're required to provide getting started documentation that describes how users get started with using your service in the context of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. You can work on this task in parallel while you develop your service.

1. Log in to the [Provider workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/){: external}.
2. From the Provider workbench dashboard, click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
3. Filter for IBM Cloud listing tasks, and click **Start** in the Guidance task tile.
4. Follow the Guidance task workflow to publish your getting started documentation in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} doc app.

Your catalog metadata must link to your published documentation URL. Defining your offering in the resource management console includes adding your URL value to the `documentationURL` metadata and `instructionsURL` field in the **Offering** tab.

## Create your service announcement
{: #announcement}

In addition to your getting started documentation, you're also required to create marketing content to announce the availability of your service through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} newsletter and social media channels. You can work on this task in parallel while you develop your service.

1. Log in to the [Provider workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/){: external}.
2. From the Provider workbench dashboard, click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
3. Filter for IBM Cloud listing tasks, and click **Start** in the Marketing task tile.
4. Follow the Marketing task workflow to create and submit your service announcement.

After you submit your service announcement, an IBM marketing manager reviews and approves it, and then publishes it to the appropriate channels after your service is released.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

Now that you started the tasks for creating your getting started documentation and service announcement, you're ready to define your offering in the resource management console. See [Step 2: Defining your offering in the resource management console](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#step2-define).
