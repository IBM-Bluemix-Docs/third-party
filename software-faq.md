If your product is not approved, you receive feedback in the console. The feedback includes why your product was not approved and what items need to be updated to receive approval. After you update the product, you can resubmit your product for approval.

If you can't find the product that you are onboarding, first make sure that you are in the correct account. If you are in the correct account and your product is not listed on the My products page, your product was possibly deleted. Unfortunately, if your in-progress product was deleted, you must restart the onboarding process.
