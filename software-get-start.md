# Getting started with software 
{: #sw-getting-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"} 
{: toc-completion-time="10m"} 

Welcome to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}! To start selling your software on our cloud platform, first complete a few tasks: provide your company and product details, create a test environment, and set up access for your team to help with the onboarding process.
{: shortdesc}

The process to sell third-party software is currently experimental and available solely for vendors that understand the onboarding process is still under development. With the current release, you have the option to bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, contact us at kala.nenkova@ibm.com.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #sw-getstart-prereqs}

* Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more information.
* Verify that you're assigned the administrator role on all account management services and all identity and access enabled services. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services) for more information. 

## Provide your company and product details
{: #sw-company-product}
{: step}

1. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/partner-center/sell/){: external}, and click **Get started** on the Sell on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} page. 
2. Enter the legal name of your company. 
3. Enter the name of your product. 

  The name doesn't have to be finalized at this point. You have the option to update it later in the onboarding process. 
  {: tip}

4. Review the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Digital Provider Agreement](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/000002-partner-docs/PartnerAgreement/5.0.0/IBM.Digital.Provider.Agreement.Referral.Only.Terms.03062020.clean.pdf){: external}, and then select the **I understand and confirm that I have signed the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Digital Provider Agreement** checkbox.
5. Click **Save** to continue. 

## Create a test environment
{: #sw-create-testenv}
{: step}

You, or a member of your team, uses the test environment to validate that the software is ready to be published in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. It includes a private catalog that's used to add your software from an external repository or file upload during the testing and validation phase. 

1. In the console, click **Create** in the "Create your test environment" section on the Before you begin page.
2. Enter the name of your private catalog, and click **Create**. The private catalog and its contents will be visible only to the users you choose.

## Set up access for your team
{: #sw-team-access}
{: step}

If you want to enlist team members to help with the onboarding process, you need to assign them specific levels of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access. To streamline the process, you can organize your team members into a single entity by adding them to an access group. 

1. In the console, click **Assign** in the "Assign access for your team" section on the Before you begin page.
2. Enter the name of the access group, and click **Assign**. Members of this group are assigned the following roles by default:

  * Administrator on the catalog management service
  * Editor on the user management service
  * Editor on the product lifecycle service
  * Editor on the IAM access groups service
  * Viewer on all account management services
  
  For more information about the actions associated with each role, see [Actions and roles for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles).

## Next steps
{: #sw-getstart-next}

Now that you completed the getting started tasks, you're ready to [continue with the onboarding process](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-sw-product-details). 

To get an overview of all the tasks involved in the process, see the [checklist for selling software on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-checklist-software).
