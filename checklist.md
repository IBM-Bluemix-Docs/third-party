{: #checklist}

Use the following checklists to track all the tasks required to define, develop, and publish your integrated billing service.
{:shortdesc}

## Defining your service
{: #define}

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Learn about the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform. | ☐ I understand how the provisioning layer, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), the catalog, the Open Service Broker, and the metering service work together. | Unlike an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} referral service, an integrated billing service uses the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform to create, bind, delete, and charge for service instances. [Learn](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-how-it-works#how-it-works) about the critical components that contain the platform to jump-start your development. | Documentation |
| Register your offering in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider workbench. | ☐ I completed the content task. <br><br>☐ I received approval to publish my offering as an integrated billing service. <br><br> ☐ I received an email with my documentation URL value. <br><br> | Your first step is to register your offering in the Provider workbench. For more information, see the [Getting started tutorial](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-get-started#get-started). | Provider workbench |
| Publish your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} docs. | ☐ I started the guidance task in the Provider workbench. <br><br>☐ I received my `Documentation URL`. <br><br> ☐ I successfully published my docs. <br><br> | We know that your third-party documentation that's hosted on your website is great. However, now that you're delivering an integrated billing service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you need to deliver documentation that is customized to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} integrated billing experience. For more information, see [Creating your documentation](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-content-tasks#content-tasks). | Provider workbench |
| Publish your marketing announcement. | ☐ I started the marketing task in the Provider workbench. <br><br>  ☐ I successfully published my marketing announcement. <br><br>  | Create your marketing collateral to announce availability for your service through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} newsletter and social media channels. For more information, see [Creating your marketing announcement](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-announcement#announcement). | Provider workbench |
| Register your offering in the resource management console. | ☐ I defined a unique and meaningful `service-name` as my resource name.<br><br>  ☐ I successfully validated I have a record in the resource management console. <br><br>  | You use the resource management console to create a unique offering. For more information, see [the steps to register your offering](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#register). | Resource management console |
| Complete the Offering page in the resource management console. | ☐ Using the value that is provided in my Provider workbench offering email, I correctly set my documentation URL and instruction URL. <br><br>  ☐ I provided a URL that points to unique terms of service page with no billing or payment clauses.<br><br>  ☐ I understand and correctly specified whether **Plan changes supported?** is enabled. ☐ I understand and correctly specified whether my service is Bindable.| Provide catalog metadata in the resource management console that is displayed on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tile. For more information, see [the steps to enter your offering metadata](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#offering-metadata). | Resource management console |
| Complete the Access Management page in the resource management console. | ☐ I successfully enabled IAM. <br><br>  ☐ I saved the one-time generated IAM API key that was created for me. I understand that the API key isn’t stored in the resource management console and I can’t retrieve it later.<br><br> ☐ I understand that the Access Management page can’t be completed until I develop and host an open service broker, and then derive my redirect URI.<br><br> ☐ After hosting my open service broker, I returned to the IAM page and successfully completed the page.| Register your offering with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM in the resource management console. IAM enables you to securely authenticate users for both platform services and control access to resources consistently across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. For more information, see [the steps to register with IAM](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#reg-iam). | Resource management console |
| Develop one or more pricing plans in the resource management console. | ☐ I provided a free plan with a unique name.<br><br>  ☐ (Optional) I worked with my IBM representative to define a paid plan, subscription, or metered, and I understand that I must remove the default subscription plan to create a metered plan.<br><br> ☐ (Optional) I understand that I'm required to host and develop automated hourly usage submission.| How will you charge for your service? The resource management console provides free or paid plans. For more information, see [the steps to develop a pricing plan](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#pricing-plan). | Resource management console |
| Export your catalog metadata from the resource management console. | ☐ I understand that some of the metadata I provide in the resource management console Offering and Pricing pages must be exported and provided in my Open Service Broker. <br><br>  ☐ I obtained my `catalog.json` file from the Deployments page, and I'm ready to map the services array to the metadata in my Open Service Broker.<br><br> | Now that you defined your service in the resource management console, you can download a `catalog.json` file and use it to inform the development of your Open Service Broker. For more information, see [the steps to export your metadata](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step2-define#export-metadata). | Resource management console |

## Developing your service
{: #develop}

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Learn about the Open Service Broker specification version 2.12. | ☐ I read through the Open Service Broker specification and I understand that I must develop my own Open Service Broker. <br><br>  |  Service brokers manage the lifecycle of services. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform interacts with Open Service Brokers to create and manage service instances and service bindings. For more information, see [Developing and hosting your service brokers](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step3-osb). | Documentation |
| View the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} broker samples. | ☐ I cloned the repo, browsed the broker samples, and I'm ready to use these samples to start development. <br><br>  |  [https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers](https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers){: external} | Code examples |
| View the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker API documentation. | ☐ I understand the several required endpoints that the code in my Open Service Broker must support. <br><br>  ☐ I understand that if my service can be bound to apps in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, it must return API endpoints and credentials to my service users. <br><br> ☐ I understand that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has defined extended API endpoints that allow service instances to be disabled and reenabled. |  The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker extends the Open Service Broker 2.12 specification. Learn about the [required endpoints](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step3-osb#docs) your service broker must use. | Documentation |
| Use your catalog metadata to start developing your service broker. | ☐ I understand that some of the metadata I provided in the resource management console must be exported and provided in my Open Service Broker.  <br><br>  ☐ I added the required GUIDs, and other required values listed in my `catalog.json` file, to the services array in my sample Open Service Broker. | After you download a `catalog.json` file from the resource management console, you can use it to inform the development of your Open Service Broker. For more information, see [the steps to use exported metadata to guide development](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step3-osb#use-metadata). | Development environment and documentation |
| Host your Open Service Broker. | ☐ I understand that the hosted location of my service broker must follow Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2. <br><br> | Your service broker must be hosted as part of an app that can respond to REST API calls. And your hosted location must meet {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} security guidelines. For more information, see [the steps to host your service broker](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step3-osb#host). | Development environment and documentation |
| Test your hosted Open Service Broker. | ☐ I validated each of the API endpoints my service broker supports by running curl commands against my hosted service broker. <br><br> | Validate your service broker by running curl commands against the different endpoints you’re enabling. For more information, see [the steps to test your service broker](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step3-osb#broker-test).| Development environment and documentation |
| Derive and set your IAM redirect URI. | ☐ I successfully derived my IAM redirect URI by using the hosted location of my Open Service Broker and some authentication information. <br><br> ☐ I successfully completed the Access Management page by specifying my redirect URI and correctly setting my client ID. <br><br> | When you define your service in resource management console, you generate a client ID, but note that you likely didn’t have a redirect URI at the time. The client ID is set to `false`. Until you return to the resource management console with your redirect URI, you won't have a true Client ID. For more information, see [the steps to derive your redirect URI](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step4-iam#redirect-uri). | Development environment and the resource management console |
| Develop your Open Authorization (OAuth) flow for authentication. | ☐ I understand that IAM supports Open ID Connect (OIDC). <br><br> ☐ I found my IAM regional endpoint and I successfully redirect users from `dashboard_url` to my assembled redirect URI, and I store the user's `access_token` returned in my response so it can be used during authentication. <br><br> | Users that visit your service dashboard must be correctly authenticated. Develop OAuth token-based authentication and authorization by using IAM. For more information, see [the steps to develop your OAuth flow](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step4-iam#oauth). | Development environment and documentation|
| Validate user authorization. | ☐ I can get an access token for an API key. <br><br> ☐ I can validate authorization for users to the service instance. <br><br> | After developing your OAuth flow for authentication, you must validate that users are correctly authorized, ensuring that users of your service can access your service dashboard. For more information, see [the steps to validate](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step4-iam#validate). | Development environment and documentation |

## Publishing and testing your service
{: #pubtest}

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Publish your service in limited visibility mode. | ☐ I successfully registered my hosted Open Service Broker on the Deployments page in the resource management console. <br><br> ☐ I successfully created new deployments, and published my offering to one or more regions. <br><br> |  Now that your hosted service brokers meet the Open Service Broker specification, you can publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For more information, see [the steps to publish your service](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step5-pubtest). | Resource management console |
| Test your offering. | ☐ I can see my service in the catalog. <br><br> ☐ I validated authentication from the service instance dashboard. <br><br> ☐ I validated that my service is displayed correctly in the catalog. <br><br> ☐ I can select a plan and create a service instance. <br><br> ☐ I can delete a service instance. <br><br> ☐ I can connect my service to another application. <br><br> ☐ I can disconnect my service and delete the connection. <br><br>  ☐ I can generate a service key and delete that service key. <br><br> ☐ I worked with my IBM representative to validate that my offering correctly supports the enable and disable endpoints. <br><br> ☐ Because my offering has a metered plan, I successfully tested usage submission. | Now that your hosted service brokers meet the Open Service Broker specification, you can publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For more information, see [the steps to test your service](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-step5-pubtest). | {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console |
