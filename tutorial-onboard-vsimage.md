# Onboarding a sample virtual server image to your private catalog
{: #vsimage-onboard}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="cloud-object-storage, vpc"} 
{: toc-completion-time="45m"} 

This tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample virtual server image with Terraform to your private catalog. By completing this tutorial, you learn how to import the sample virtual server image, configure the deployment and other details, and validate that you can deploy the image to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC). 
{: shortdesc}

The process to sell third-party software is available solely for providers that understand that the onboarding process is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or offer your third-party software for free. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.

This tutorial is one of four in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a [sample virtual server image with Terraform](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/tree/v1.0){: external} to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your product's needs.

## Before you begin
{: #vsimage-onboard-prereqs}

1. Create an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and upload your image to a bucket.
2. Create your [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started). 
3. [Import your custom image to all regions](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/tree/main#import-your-custom-image-to-all-supported-regions){: external} in which you want your software to be available. 
4. Create your [Terraform template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-config). 
5. Upload your Terraform template to your GitHub repository. 

  Use the [latest release of the sample Terraform code](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/releases/tag/v1.0 ){: external} as an example of how to set up your repository.
  {: tip}
   
6. Make sure you're assigned the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) editor role on the catalog management service and product lifecycle service. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services) for more information.
7. Complete the previous tutorials in the series: [Registering the sample virtual server image in the Partner Center](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-vsimage-register) and [Defining the product details of the sample virtual server image](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-vsimage-define). 

## Import the TGZ file to your private catalog
{: #vsimage-onboard-import}
{: step}

Your private catalog is included in your test environment, which was created for you during the [registration of the sample virtual server image in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Partner Center](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-vsimage-register).

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Partner Center > Sell > My products**. 
1. Select **isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample** from the list of products. 
1. From the Software tab, click **Import a version**.
1. Confirm that **Public repository** is selected as the repository type.
1. Click **Virtual server image** from the list of examples that's displayed to populate the **Repository or TGZ archive** field.

  Alternatively, you can copy and paste `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/releases/download/v1.0/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample.tar.gz` in the field.  

1. Enter `1.0.0` as the version. 
1. Select **This Terraform template is a virtual server image**. 
1. Click **Add**.

## Configure the deployment values
{: #vsimage-onboard-cfgdeploy}
{: step}

After you import the sample virtual server image to your private catalog, you're ready to configure the deployment values.

1. From the details page for the sample virtual server image, click **1.0.0** in the Version list table to navigate to the Configure product tab. 
1. Scroll to the Configure the deployment details section, and click **Add deployment values**. 
1. Select the **Parameter** checkbox to select all options, and click **Add deployment values**.
1. Customize which parameters are required for users to specify during the installation and which ones are hidden from users altogether. For the purposes of this tutorial, configure each parameter as described in the following table.

| Parameter | Description | Required for users to specify? | Hidden from users? |
| --- | ---------- | --- | --- | 
| **`TF_VERSION`** | The version of the Terraform engine that's used in the Schematics workspace. | False | True |
| **`region`** | The region in which the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance is located. | True | False |
| **`ssh_key_name`** | The name of the public SSH key to use when creating the virtual server instance. | True | False |
| **`subnet_id`** | The ID of the subnet within the VPC that the virtual server instance uses. | True | False |
| **`vsi_instance_name`** | The name of the virtual server instance. | True | False |
| **`vsi_profile`** | The profile of the compute CPU and memory resources to use when creating the virtual server instance. | True | False |
| **`vsi_security_group`** | The name of the security group that is created. | True | False |
{: caption="Table 1. Deployment values for a sample virtual server image" caption-side="top"} 

<br><br>

Next, update the configuration type of the **`region`** parameter:

1. From the Deployment values table, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg), and select **Edit**.
1. Click **Update** next to the `This configuration value is type string` text.
1. Select **VPC region** from the **Configuration type** list, and click **Update**.
1. Click **Update** to save your changes. 

## Add your license agreements
{: #vsimage-onboard-eula}
{: step}

1. Click **Add license agreements**.
1. Enter the name and URL of the end user license agreement.
1. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## Review your readme file 
{: #vsimage-onboard-readme}

1. Click **Edit readme**.
1. Click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](../icons/icon_write.svg), and update the description with the following sentence:

  `Create and deploy a virtual server with ease by using a custom image.`

1. Click **Update** to save your changes. 

## Validate the sample virtual server image 
{: #vsimage-onboard-validate}
{: step}

Validate that the sample virtual server image can be successfully deployed to your VPC as the final onboarding step. 

1. Click **Validate product**.
1. In the Configure Schematics workspace section, accept the default value that's displayed in the **Name** field. 
1. In the Deployment values section, update the Parameters without default values table as follows:

  * **`ssh_key_name`**: Enter the name of your public SSH key. To find your SSH key name, go to the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **VPC Infrastructure** > **SSH keys**.
  * **`subnet_id`**: Enter the ID of your subnet. To find the ID, click **Subnets** in the VPC Infrastructure navigation, and select the subnet from the Subnets for VPC table.
  * **`vsi_instance_name`**: Enter the name of your virtual server instance. 
  * **`vsi_security_group`**: Enter the name of your security group.
1. In the Validation summary panel, select **I have read and agree to the following license agreements**. 
1. Click **Validate**.

  You can monitor the progress of the validation process from the Schematics workspace by clicking **View logs**.
