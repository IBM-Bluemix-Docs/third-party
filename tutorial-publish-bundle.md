This tutorial is one of four in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish an Operator bundle. It uses a fictitious company that's called *Example Corp* to onboard the real Akka Cluster Operator. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your product's needs.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.
