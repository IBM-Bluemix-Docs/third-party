# Publishing your software to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #sw-publish}

As the last step in the onboarding process, you can submit a request to publish your third-party software to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. When you publish to the catalog, your software is publicly available for all users.

The process to sell third-party software is available solely for providers that understand that the onboarding process is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.
