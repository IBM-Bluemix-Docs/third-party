# Selling on IBM Cloud
{: #selling-clouds}

Are you looking to deploy your software or services onto {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}? You can use our broad portfolio of managed infrastructure services and developer tools to build your applications on the public cloud.  
{: shortdesc} 

## Software or services? 
Do you want to sell your third-party service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}? Or do you want to onboard your software to our {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform? You might have a software application that users can manage and install, or a software-based service you can manage for users. 

You can use our expanding catalog of software solutions to take advantage of a simplified installation process. You can also bring your own licenses, or deliver your third-party software for free. For more information, see [Software](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#software). 

If you have a service that you want to provide, you can offer it as an integrated billing service. Offering it as an integrated billing service means that users can create an instance of your service automatically. You can onboard your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by defining your service, building pricing plans, enabling security, and managing the deployment of your service in different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment. For more information, see [Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#services). 

### Software 
Software includes containerized applications or system images that you can deliver to your customer to run on their own infrastructure. For software, the cost for the underlying compute lies on the customer. 

Types of third-party software that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports include: 
- Starter kits 
- Cloud Paks 
- Operators 
- Images (VSI, OVA, VNF) through terraform templates 
- Terraform templates 
- Helm charts 
- Operators 

These third-party software items can be deployed onto specified targets, including IBM Kubernetes Service, Red Hat OpenShift, and vCenter Server.

The process is as simple as providing company information, creating a suitable test environment, setting up team access, and inviting team members to join.  For more information, see [Getting set up to sell software](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-get-started) and [Onboarding your software](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-sw-validate).

### Services
Managed services are similar to software as a service (SaaS). The customer runs the infrastructure in their own account and deploys instances by using their integration with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Resource Controller. For services, the cost of the underlying compute lies on the vendor.  Tools that are used for onboarding include the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Provider Workbench and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource management console. 

Types of third-party services that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports include: 
- Computing

- AI and Machine Learning by integrating with IBM Watson 
- Analytics 
- Blockchain 
- Databases
- Developer Tools
- Logging and Monitoring 
- Migration Tools 
- Integration 
- Internet of Things 
- Security

The process is as simple as registering your service with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, listing service types, and defining those service types. For more information, see [Getting set up to sell services](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-sw-getting-started) and [Onboarding your service](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-overview).
