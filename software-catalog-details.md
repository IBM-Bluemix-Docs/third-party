# Defining your catalog entry 
{: #sw-catalog-details}

During the onboarding process, you define the details of your catalog entry, which include your product logo and description. Your catalog entry is displayed in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog so you want to make sure to provide details that help users find your product when searching the catalog. 
{: shortdesc}

The process to sell third-party software is available solely for providers that understand that the onboarding process is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.

Support for third-party products is provided by the third-party provider. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party product, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. However, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} shares analysis with the third-party provider, if needed, and can work with the third-party provider to help solve the issue.
  * Community products are provided by open source communities. If a root cause analysis determines that a support issue is a defect in an open source or community product, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} closes the case and refers users to the community or forum for assistance.
