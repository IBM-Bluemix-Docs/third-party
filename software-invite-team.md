# Inviting team members to help onboard software
{: #sw-invite-team}

If you want to enlist team members to help onboard your third-party software to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you must invite them to your account, and assign them access to the product lifecycle and catalog management services. 
{: shortdesc}

The process to sell third-party software is available solely for providers that understand that the onboarding process is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.

When you invite team members to your account, they are assigned editor access to the following services by default:

* Product lifecycle: Editors can complete onboarding tasks, update the visibility of products at the account level, and request approval to publish products to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. 
* Catalog management: Editors can onboard products to private catalogs, update the visibility of products at the account and private catalog levels, and restrict the visiblity of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

Complete the following steps to invite team members to your account: 

1. Go to the [Partner Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/partner-center/sell){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Team**.
1. Click **Invite users**.
1. Select the user type:

  * Business: A team member who can provide certain details, such as the product logo, description, and customer support experience. 
  * Technical: A team member who can import the product to your test environment, configure the deployment details, and validate it's ready for use. 

1. Enter the email address of each user. 
1. Click **Invite**.
